### Hello World! 👋

My name is Bach! I am a full stack web developer! 

- ✅ I recently completed a [Pokédex](https://bndiep.github.io/pokedex/) app using React.js and Styled Components!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a COVID data vizualization app using React.js and a library called Nivo. I'm also pairing with a friend to build a social media app! From time to time, I follow the Daily UI prompts to practice my design skills!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and MongoDB.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any good first issue open source projects here on GitHub!
- 🤔 I’m looking for job that can help others and enrich my learning as a 🔰 developer!~
- 💬 Ask me about what my name means in Vietnamese and how to pronounce it in all the ways.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to eat my [thịt kho trung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%E1%BB%8Bt_kho_t%C3%A0u) (braised pork belly with egg) with a side of watermelon 🍉. I know weird. But a great balance of lightly sweet and savory!
