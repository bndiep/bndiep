### Hi there 👋

My name is Bach! I am a full stack web developer! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio and potentially a little side project called 'Into the Shadow (Art) Realm.'
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tailwind CSS (it's great btw) and Vue.js.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any good first issue open source projects here on GitHub!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with all new tech that I am unfamiliar with!
- 💬 Ask me about what my name means in Vietnamese and how to pronounce it in all the ways.
- 📫 How to reach me: bachdiep.dev@gmail.com || Twitter: @itsabach || LinkedIn: bachdiep
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to eat my [thịt kho trung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%E1%BB%8Bt_kho_t%C3%A0u) (braised pork belly with egg) with a side of watermelon 🍉. I know weird. But a great balance of lightly sweet and savory!
